# Hello World in Java
This example project is written in Java and tested automatically. 

### The assignment
The tests are currently failing because of an output mismatch. Fixing the `System.out.println` in the main method will make the tests green. Your program should output "Hello world!"

### Locating the Code
Go to 
src > main > java > com > example > project

### Setup command
N/A

### Test command
`gradle test`

Note: all commands should be entered in the terminal. That is the section near the bottom of the screen. 

### Notes
- Have fun! 

### Submission
```
git add . 
git commit -m "submitting"
git push
```
